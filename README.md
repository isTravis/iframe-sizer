# Iframe Sizer

This repo allows you to pass in a URL and width as params to the site and render an Iframe with that fixed width. The width should be given as a number, with no following unit. For example, use `1280`, and don't use `1280px`.


Example URL:

```
localhost:8080/?url=https://www.sitetoembed.com&width=1280
```
